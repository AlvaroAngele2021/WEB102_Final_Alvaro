## Notes

At first, the logic for this app was pretty easy to understand as I knew what type of functions
each page and link had to contain, and what kind of information was to be rendered. I had some
trouble connecting to my database and performing different types of manipulation on it, however
after looking at the examples, it managed to make it work.
